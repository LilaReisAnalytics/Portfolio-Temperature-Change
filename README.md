# Temperature Change Analysis 
### Welcome to my analysis report!

Climate change is one of the important issues facing the world. The best proof of this situation is the historical change in temperature. 

But what really causes it? 

In this analysis we compare temperature change with Population, Co2 emission and Deforestation. However, The purpose of this project is to investigate if there is any hope of stopping global warming

Data Used:

Temperature Change: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sevgisarac/temperature-change
