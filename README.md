# Temperature Change Analysis 
### Welcome to my analysis report!

Climate change is one of the important issues facing the world. The best proof of this situation is the historical change in temperature. 

But what really causes it? 

In this analysis we compare temperature change with Population, Co2 emission and Deforestation. However, The purpose of this project is to investigate if there is any hope of stopping global warming

Data Used:

In analyzing temperature variations across G20 countries and selected developing nations from 2015 to 2020, it becomes evident that certain countries experience more pronounced changes. Among the G20 nations, Canada, Germany, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey exhibit notably higher variations in temperature, indicating significant fluctuations within their climates. Similarly, within the group of developing countries, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kenya emerge with the highest levels of temperature variation.
