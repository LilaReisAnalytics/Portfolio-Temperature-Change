# Temperature Change Analysis 
### Welcome to my analysis report!
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LilaReisAnalytics/Portfolio-Temperature-Change)

Climate change is one of the important issues facing the world. The best proof of this situation is the historical change in temperature. 

But what really causes it? 

In this analysis I compare temperature change with Population, Co2 emission and Deforestation. However, The purpose of this project is to investigate if there is any hope of stopping global warming

Data Used:


[Temperature Change](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sevgisarac/temperature-change)

[Population](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

[CO2 Emissions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/co2-emissions-by-country?select=co2_emissions_kt_by_country.csv)

[Deforestation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chiticariucristian/deforestation-and-forest-loss)

In analyzing temperature variations across G20 countries and selected developing nations from 2015 to 2020, it becomes evident that certain countries experience more pronounced changes. Among the G20 nations, Canada, Germany, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey exhibit notably higher variations in temperature, indicating significant fluctuations within their climates. Similarly, within the group of developing countries, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kenya emerge with the highest levels of temperature variation.

- Serbia, despite its lower population density, experiences a notable temperature change of 1.56°C. This can be attributed to its geographical location and climate transition, as well as the urbanization and urban heat island effect.
- Temperature change is not necessarily about population size. Countries with high temperature changes are mainly reliant on fossil fuels for power/energy generation.

Why are developing countries more vulnerable to climate change?


Developing countries are weaker socially, financially and economically compared to countries. They have limited resources to fight the effect of global climate change.

The vast majority of scientists around the world agree that our temperature is changing at a faster rate than ever recorded in human history because of our use of fuels such as coal and oil, so-called fossil fuels

Among the many gifts that forests give us, one of them is helping to slow down climate change.
Trees capture greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, preventing them from accumulating in the atmosphere and warming our planet.

- Brazil, avg. Temperature Variation: 0.53°C, Deforestation -2,68M. Brazil with nearly the worst rate of deforestation does not show as high a temperature variance as Canada. 


- In Brazil we have the Amazon, one of the largest rainforests in the world and the most important. The Amazon rainforest plays an important role in regulating the world's oxygen and carbon cycles. It produces about 6% of the world's oxygen and has long been believed to act as a carbon sink, meaning it readily absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Although, through this graph in Brazil there is an incomparable deforestation -2,68M and Temperature change 0.53°C

## Conclusion : Taking Action Against Climate change

How can all of us make a difference?

Addressing climate change requires collective effort and urgent action. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting natural habitats, promoting sustainable living, advocating for policy change, and raising awareness, we can make a difference in averting the rise in temperature and building a more sustainable future for all. As individuals, communities, and societies, we have the power to enact positive change. By embracing sustainable practices, supporting climate-friendly policies, and spreading awareness, we can all contribute to the global effort to combat climate change and create a healthier planet for generations to come.
